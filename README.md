### ✅ How to use this template
1. Copy this file into a new repo for each lab fix.  
2. Replace placeholders:  
   - `[LAB CODE]` → GSP1079, GSP1080, etc.  
   - `[STEP / ERROR NAME]` → Step 8 Promotion Error, Step 3 Deploy Fail, etc.  
   - `[Paste the exact error message here]` → The error you see.  
   - `[Original lab command that fails]` → The command in the lab instructions.  
   - `[Fixed command / workaround]` → The working command.  
   - `[Insert YouTube link here]` → Link to your short video explaining the fix.  
3. Keep formatting exactly — code blocks make it copy-paste-friendly.

This keeps **all your lab fixes consistent, concise, and safe**, and you can churn them out quickly for every broken lab.  

If you want, I can also draft a **ready-made repo README for your next video** using this template so you just swap in the commands — it’ll be fully ready to push.  

Do you want me to do that for your next lab?
